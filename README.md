Introduction
------------

Calendar Sync for Astrid will generate iCal format calendars with all a user's Astrid tasks that have a due date/time.  It uses the Astrid API to login and fetch a token, then uses it to collect tasks.  The output is rendered into an iCal file and can be subscribed to in calendar apps such as Google Calendar and Microsoft Office Outlook.  An iCal download is also provided.
